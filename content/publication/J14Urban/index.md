abstract: In this paper, the requirements of digital terrestrial television broadcasting are analyzed. One structure, named as urban-rural dual structure, is emphasized in the future broadcasting system, especially in those developing countries, such as China, Russia, and Brazil. A comparison between Shanghai and Fengyang in China is given to help understanding this unique structure. Some technical consideration on the structure is presented for the future of broadcast television.
